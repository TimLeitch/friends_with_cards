# Steering Document - Friends with Cards (FWC)

## Project Vision

Create a browser-based, real-time multiplayer card game platform that allows friends and family to play card games together without physical cards. The platform should be simple to use, responsive, and support multiple card game types.

## Core Principles

### 1. Simplicity First

- **Minimal Complexity**: Avoid over-engineering and unnecessary features
- **Easy to Use**: Intuitive interface that requires minimal learning
- **Fast Development**: Focus on core functionality before adding extras

### 2. Performance Matters

- **Real-time Responsiveness**: Sub-100ms latency for game actions
- **Smooth Animations**: 60fps rendering for card movements
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Minimal memory and CPU footprint

### 3. Learning Focus

- **Educational Value**: Use this project to learn modern web technologies
- **Best Practices**: Implement industry-standard patterns and practices
- **Iterative Development**: Build, test, and improve incrementally

### 4. Local Multiplayer Priority

- **Same Network**: Designed for players on the same local network
- **Low Latency**: Optimized for minimal network delay
- **Simple Setup**: No complex networking configuration required

## Project Constraints

### Technical Constraints

- **Browser Only**: Must work entirely in web browsers
- **No Native Apps**: No mobile apps, desktop apps, or browser extensions
- **Standard Web APIs**: Use only standard web technologies
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Resource Constraints
