## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **WebSocket Complexity**: Start with simple implementation, iterate
- **Canvas Performance**: Begin with basic rendering, optimize later
- **Database Design**: Plan schema carefully, test early

### Timeline Risks

- **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined features, defer extras
- **Learning Curve**: Start simple, research as needed
- **Testing Delays**: Begin testing early, iterate quickly

This task list provides a structured approach to building the digital tabletop card game. Tasks are prioritized by importance and dependency, with realistic timeframes for completion.
